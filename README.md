## Introduction

The Simpsons-Face Identification project uses deep learning techniques to recognize and classify characters from "The Simpsons" based on facial images. This project can be used for various applications, such as identifying characters in episodes or creating interactive applications involving "The Simpsons."

## Features

- **Character Recognition**: Identifies and classifies characters from "The Simpsons."
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models for quick deployment.
- **Custom Training**: Allows users to train models on their own dataset.
- **Web Interface**: Simple web interface for uploading images and viewing results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of characters from "The Simpsons." The dataset can be obtained from various sources or generated by collecting frames from the show. For training purposes, the dataset should be labeled with the character names.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (version 2.0 or higher)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simpsons-face-identification.git
    cd simpsons-face-identification
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
    ```env
    FLASK_APP=app.py
    FLASK_ENV=development
    ```

5. **Download or prepare your dataset**

    Ensure you have a dataset directory structured as follows:
    ```
    dataset/
    ├── character_1/
    │   ├── img1.jpg
    │   ├── img2.jpg
    ├── character_2/
    │   ├── img1.jpg
    │   ├── img2.jpg
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Web Application

To start the web application, use the following command:
```bash
flask run
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Identifying Characters

Upload an image through the web interface, and the application will identify and display the character(s) in the image.

## Model Training

To train your own model on a custom dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the dataset** as described in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.
2. **Run the training script**
    ```bash
    python train.py --dataset dataset --model output/model.h5
    ```

The trained model will be saved in the `output` directory.
